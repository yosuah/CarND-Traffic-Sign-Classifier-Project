## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---
Train and validate a model to classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). 
After the model is trained, test it on other images of German traffic signs found on the web.

Solution
---
LeNet-5 architecture with dropout, regularization and hyperparameter search, achieving 0.913 test set accuracy.
Code is availabale in [Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb](Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb), a detailed
writeup is in [writeup.md](writeup.md).
